# GitHub's Global Meetup Program

## Overview

_GitHubâ€™s Global Meetup Program_ is a community engagement initiative designed to enhance GitHub product adoption by incorporating GitHub-centric sessions into existing developer meetups worldwide. We collaborate with established developer groups (e.g., language communities, cloud platform meetups, tech user groups) to provide Copilot-powered demos, GitHub-product talks, and workshops, In return, eligible partners gain access to a variety of sponsorship options to support their meetup communities.

## Eligibility Requirements
Meetups eligible for sponsorship must be:
- A community-organized technical community (e.g. language communities, cloud platform meetups, tech user groups) with a minimum of 50 active members
- Run by a verifiable organizer who has been publicly associated with the community either on Meetup.com or another platform
- Has hosted at least 4 events with 50+ RSVPs in the last year.

## Tiered Value Exchange
To align value with impact, the Global Meetup Program provides a three-tiered system of sponsorship benefits. Organizers can move to higher benefit levels by delivering more frequent GitHub-focused value back to the community.
