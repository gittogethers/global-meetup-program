# GitHub's Global Meetup Program

## Overview

_GitHubâ€™s Global Meetup Program_ is a community engagement initiative designed to enhance GitHub product adoption by incorporating GitHub-focused sessions into existing developer meetups worldwide. We collaborate with established developer groups (e.g., language communities, cloud platform meetups, tech user groups) to make it easy for them to host GitHub-focused sessions, Copilot-powered demos, GitHub-product talks, and workshops. In return, eligible partners gain access to a variety of sponsorship options to support their meetup communities.

## Eligibility Requirements
Meetups eligible for sponsorship must be:
- A community-organized technical community (e.g. language communities, cloud platform meetups, tech user groups) with a minimum of 50 active members
- Run by a verifiable organizer who has been publicly associated with the community either on Meetup.com or another platform
- Has hosted at least 4 events with 50+ RSVPs in the last year.

## Tiered Value Exchange
To align value with impact, the Global Meetup Program provides a three-tiered system of sponsorship benefits. Organizers can move to higher benefit levels by delivering more frequent GitHub-focused value back to the community.

## How do I get started?

If you're interested in joining our Global Meetup Program, please open an [Meetup Organizer Application issue](https://github.com/gittogethers/global-meetup-program/issues/new?template=organizer-application.yaml) in this repo. We will review your application and then indicate your acceptance via an `approved` or `rejected` label.

## What do I do once I'm approved?

After you're approved, the Program Manager will reach out inviting you to get onboarded to our Meetup Pro account, give you access to GitHub content and add you to our meetup newsletter distro. 

Then, every month that you deliver GitHub-related content, you can share a [Monthly Meetup Activity Report](https://github.com/gittogethers/global-meetup-program/issues/new?template=monthly-report.yaml) where the GitHub Program Manager will be able to review and assess your participation level. As you move into higher levels of participation, the Program Manager will reach out to provide additional benefits outlined in the value exchange portion of this README.
